FIXME tener que iniciar transmicion 2 veces para que aparezca video en youtube

FIXME sincronizacion de audio y video
    posibles soluciones:
    [x] usar 48000khz
    [ ] transmitir audio directo de tarjeta virtual
    [ ] buscar como usar timestamps en audio
    [ ] intentar reemplazar ffmpeg con obs
    [ ] pasar audio a programa en c++ y video con audio a ffmpeg u obs

    -isync input_index (input)
        Assign an input as a sync source.
        This will take the difference between the start times of the target and reference inputs and offset the timestamps of the target
        file by that difference. The source timestamps of the two inputs should derive from the same clock source for expected results.
        If copyts is set then start_at_zero must also be set. If either of the inputs has no starting timestamp then no sync adjustment is made.
        Acceptable values are those that refer to a valid ffmpeg input index. If the sync reference is the target index itself or -1, then no
        adjustment is made to target timestamps. A sync reference may not itself be synced to any other input.
        Default value is -1.

    -debug_ts (global)
        Print timestamp/latency information. It is off by default. This option is mostly useful for testing and debugging purposes, and the output
        format may change from one version to another, so it should not be employed by portable scripts.
        See also the option -fdebug ts.

    -fps_mode[:stream_specifier] parameter (output,per-stream)
        Set video sync method / framerate mode. vsync is applied to all output video streams but can be overridden for a stream by setting fps_mode.
        vsync is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
        For compatibility reasons some of the values for vsync can be specified as numbers (shown in parentheses in the following table).
        passthrough (0)
        Each frame is passed with its timestamp from the demuxer to the muxer.
        cfr (1)
        Frames will be duplicated and dropped to achieve exactly the requested constant frame rate.
        vfr (2)
        Frames are passed through with their timestamp or dropped so as to prevent 2 frames from having the same timestamp.
        auto (-1)
        Chooses between cfr and vfr depending on muxer capabilities. This is the default method.
        Note that the timestamps may be further modified by the muxer, after this. For example, in the case that the format option avoid_negative_ts is enabled.
        With -map you can select from which stream the timestamps should be taken. You can leave either video or audio unchanged and sync the remaining stream(s)
        to the unchanged one.

    -frame_drop_threshold parameter
        Frame drop threshold, which specifies how much behind video frames can be before they are dropped. In frame rate units, so 1.0 is one frame. The default
        is -1.1. One possible usecase is to avoid framedrops in case of noisy timestamps or to increase frame drop precision in case of exact timestamps.

    -dts_error_threshold threshold
        Timestamp error delta threshold, expressed as a decimal number of seconds.
        The timestamp correction enabled by this option is only applied to input formats not accepting timestamp discontinuity (for which the AVFMT_TS_DISCONT flag
        is not enabled).
        If a timestamp discontinuity is detected whose absolute value is greater than threshold, ffmpeg will drop the PTS/DTS timestamp value.
        The default value is 3600*30 (30 hours), which is arbitrarily picked and quite conservative.
