# Procedural Organisms

Algorithmic audiovisual music composition, expressed as continuously developing software.

## Current state

At present, the project features a simple phase modulation-based audio synthesizer with multiple non-user-adjustable parameters, written in SCLang and meant to be run with SuperCollider (not included). This audio synthesizer is paired with an OpenGL shader programmed using the same number of parameters with corresponding behaviors.\
This, however, does not mean that the shader reacts to the synthesizer or vice versa; the task of sending messages to control the parameters of both output sources is performed by a Python program.

The software necessary to run the OpenGL shader is included as source code in two different variations:
1. **Windowed GPU Renderer:** For testing or live presentation.
2. **Offscreen Software Renderer:** Designed for servers, embedded systems, or other headless environments.

Additionally, the project includes a script that automates running all programs in the correct sequence and encodes their outputs using FFmpeg, with limited[^1] support for RTMP web video streaming.
